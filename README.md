# ★-char
★-char is a character encoding format.

It is based on the idea of a stateful bitstream, a codebook, and a container.

With the stateful bitstream and the codebook you can get glyphs as such in or out of the format; with the container you can represent a specific fixed form (and also ergonomic concerns like indexing, multitracks, metadata, and potentially specifying specific codebooks and so forth).
