All text is made up of switch codes and index codes.

A switch code is similar to a zigzag varint. A switch code must always be followed by at least one index code.

Format: 8-bit ('1' (7-bit))* '0'

A switch code specifies which megablock to switch into.

Index codes pick things out of megablocks. All switch codes are for the currently active megablock.

Megablocks are binned, with bins being of potentially different sizes. Bins are specified by a prefix code. Index codes for a given megablock use the prefix code plus an additional log_2(bin-size) + 1 bits, as usual. A specified megablock entry for each megablock switches back to expecting a control code.

Mega blocks can contain several different kinds of things, which may be partitioned into individually sized bins:
- Script glyphs
- Selectors
- Glyph partials (eg individual jamos)

Individual glyphs are all within mega blocks; a mega block is made up of scripts that share many homoglyphs, and many selectors.

Selectors do several things:
- They determine which script a give glyph belongs to, or select a specific variant of a glyph
- They add modifiers, such as diacritics, skin tone selectors, and so forth.
- They combine characters in megablock specific ways - eg the people grouping selector, or the flag formation selector, or the jamo grouping selector, or the dipthong formation selector.
