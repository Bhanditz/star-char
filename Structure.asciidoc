A block of text is made up of control codes and modal data codes.
Control codes switch modes.

Control codes:
Switch into a given Mega block.
Start with 01.

Data codes:

Mega blocks:
Script glyphs
Start with a 1.
Selectors
Start with a 00.

Individual glyphs are all within mega blocks; a mega block is made up of scripts that share many homoglyphs, and many selectors.

Selectors do several things:
- They determine which script a give glyph belongs to, or select a specific variant of a glyph
- They add modifiers, such as diacritics, skin tone selectors, and so forth.
- They combine characters in megablock specific ways - eg the people grouping selector, or the flag formation selector, or the jamo grouping selector, or the dipthong formation selector.
